## General Idea
The game sets up a war in a map where 50 countries are distributed between the players.

Each player has a randomly assigned secret objective to accomplish. The secret objective involves either occupying a certain range of countries or destroying another player. Everyone also has the common goal of occupying 30 countries. To win the game, a player must accomplish either the secret objective or the common goal.
