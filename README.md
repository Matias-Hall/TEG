# TEG
## (Tactic and Strategic War Plan)
TEG is an Argentinian board game commonly regarded as a clone of Risk.

This repository contains a [library that runs the game's logic](/TEG/). The repository also includes a command-line application that can render the game's information and obtain information from the user.

Other methods of running the game can be achieved by using the interfaces found in the Base library.

I am currently working on a unity game that runs the Base library with better graphics (or rather any graphics at all).
